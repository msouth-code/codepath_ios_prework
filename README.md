## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. **Toy Blast**
   - bright and flashy colors
   - cute background music
2. **Spotify**
   - simple background but colorful/unique playlist covers or music/album covers
   - aesthetically pleasing and thoughtful web player layout
3. **TikTok**
   - easy to navigate
   - very good editing and filming features
4. **BeReal**
   - simple concept and interface
   - muted background colors and font which makes it easier to focus on the posts

An app I'd like to build would be used to limit screen time or time on social media. A key feature would be to use the iPhone screen time minute tracking and users can make their phones show flashcards or quiz questions after a certain amount of time in oprder to unlock your phone after being on it ofr an extended amount of time. The app would mainly be used as a tool to help distracted studiers.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I didn't really encounter any challenges.
